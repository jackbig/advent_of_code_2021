TODO: remove all computation to find last. I cannot pass whole input: 
too much expansive in computation. It's better read all matrices and 
compute score reading the sequence of input.

If I want to compute score for each matrix with whole input, every time 
I read a matrix I need to compute score and last input. The next matrix will 
be a better choice if last input index is lower then the previous.
